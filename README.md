## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your project up and running:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python and Django installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andviktor/regioncms.git
   cd django-website-builder
   ```

3. **Setup Virtual Environment**:

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. If you haven't installed `virtualenv`, you can do so with:

   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

   Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install project dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Database Setup**:

   Create the database and run migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server**:

   Start the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Your project should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

7. **Usage and Customization**:

   - Customize templates in the `templates` directory.
   - Implement TopVisor integration for SERP tracking.

8. **Deployment**:

   Deploy your project to a production server of your choice. Don't forget to configure settings for a production environment, including security settings.
